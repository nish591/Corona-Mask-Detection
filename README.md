# Corona-Mask-Detection

I have built a Neural Network to classify "mask" and "without_mask" images. Using OpenCV, I have predicted on each image in a webcam video ( whether it belongs to "mask" or "without_mask" image). I have surrounded the detected face with a rectangle, and also put a text above that rectangle, depicting whether it is a masked or a non-masked image and its probability.
